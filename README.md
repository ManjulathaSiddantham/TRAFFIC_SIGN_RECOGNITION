# TRAFFIC_SIGN_RECOGNITION
I have developed a precise deep neural network for rapid and accurate recognition of various traffic signs, enhancing autonomous driving safety. 
The model efficiently detects multiple signs simultaneously, leveraging shape details from sign images to reduce accidents.
Run Traffic sighns.ipynb on jupyter notebook or google colab 
Make sure to change the GTSRB Dataset directory path and background image.
After completion of building the model,create graphical user interface in python
To do so run classify.py on cmd by typing  "python classify.py" 
It will open the graphical user interface.
I have proposed an efficient traffic sign  recognition method. to the present end, I generalized the traffic sign templates with  high accuracy .
To achieve practical detection speed, I have explored the best-performing convolutional neural network for  recognition considering the characteristics of  traffic signs. 
In some areas there will be one or two or three traffic signs will be there ,in such conditions this project can detect those three traffic signs at a a time. 
By using the images of traffic signs,this method effectively utilizes strong information of target shapes and recognize the traffic signs  in order to reduce road accicidents. 
Furthermore, you can visit the ppt and document(Pdf) which i have uploaded for complete information.
Thankyou.
